  $lang['INFO'] = 'Myrtana, the Vaduz Island, not long before the creation of magic barrier and not long after the beginning of war with orcs. Thanks to the fate, leading a rather monotonous life, Lars becomes a participant in the event that changes everything. In mysterious circumstances, twelve of the most powerful mages of the kingdom led by famous Grandmaster of Fire, Xardas, arrive on the island.';

  $lang['INTRO'] = 'Lars is a young man, who with his father(a former soldier of royal army), has a small blacksmith shop near the city of Vaduz. His father, apart from teaching him the profession, helps him in combat skills. His dream is that his son will find some peaceful job and that he wont take part in any battles. He himself, as a veteran of wars with orcs, doesnt deal well with the trauma. After smallpox and death of his wife he drinks a lot getting himself in more trouble. However, as it appears  the worst is yet to come... Mages arrive on the island and after you fulfill a task given by them, they offer you collaboration and going with them on the Khorinis Island. What will we find there? The old harbor known from Gothic 2 will be unrecognizable. Dozens moored ships, sailors, traders, knights, prisoners and travelers will fill the whole harbor neighborhood. Apart from that, the whole city will be refreshed and extended. The Khorinis Island itself will also look different: all burned down houses and destroyed constructions will look as new, there will be more roads, a few times more people, more households, inns and other interesting objects.   
                    The Valley of Mines also will look differently. The Old Camp, once in ruin, now will look as brand new, mountain fortress and collapsed mines will be full of life. There will be a few mines and not only in the Valley of Mines, but also on Khorinis. Of course, acces to the Valley of Mines will be restricted, not anyone will be able to enter. Safe conduct pass will be needed.';
  $lang['STORY_T'] = 'Story';
  $lang['STORY_1'] = '"...King Rhobar II looked at a chunk of magic ore which he was holding in front of him. The ore was a source of his kingdoms power and at the same time it could be the reason of his destruction. Masters of smithing in Nordmar have been delivering the best armor for his army and as in every war even the smallest dominance was worth one\'s weight in gold. However, even that wasn\'t enough.';
  $lang['STORY_2'] = 'The ore was definitely indispensable element of the war with orcs. The King needed swords and shields for his army, therefore the tough decision had to be made to increase delivery of the ore. From that moment, regardless of the crime committed, every offender had to work in the ore mines of Khorinis.';
  $lang['STORY_3'] = 'Rhobar looked through the window onto lively streets of Vengard. He suspected that most of the passers-by dispraised him for his last decision. He understood them but at the same time he was surprised that they still dont see how big the stake is in the war. War, from which depended the future of the kingdom and the whole civilized world.';
  $lang['STORY_4'] = 'If everything was as simple as last years conquest of Southern Islands. Local tribe was brave and belligerent but they werent able to face well-armed troops of Lord Dominique. Orcs turned out to be entirely different opponent. Myrtans and their ancestors had chance to find out about it during the First War with Orcs. Royal army was losing in many locations and a part of leaders had to resign.';
  $lang['STORY_5'] = 'However, mining of the ore was also bringing many problems to the ruler. Barons from Khorinis were constantly informing about new attempts of revolts and escapes, demanding strengthening the garrison and increasing payment During a discussion about supervision of prisoners, one of the two kings closest people suggested a controversial proposition.';
  $lang['STORY_6'] = 'It wasnt the first time that Xardas, Grandmaster of the Circle of Fire, was giving evidence of his superb expertise in the secrets of magic. The main aim of the modification is to show Kingdom of Mytrana and Khorinis island in the years of their greatness and the biggest victories. The proposal of creating a magic barrier (not letting inmates escape beyond its borders) in the opinion of many was insane and infeasible and even dangerous. The main opponents of the idea were Archmage of the Circle of Fire, Pyrokar, and kings marshal Rigaldo. This was the only reason why monarch was waiting with his decision.';
  $lang['STORY_7'] = 'King upbraid himself for unnecessary thinking. Enough of this. Its time for action. The ore has to be mined in as big quantities as possible and prisoners escape should be prevented at any cost. If there was one person being able to secure the Valley of Mines in a magic way, that person would be Xardas. It doesnt matter how, mage for sure will choose the best solution. He will give him ten, no eleven of the best mages of the kingdom. Its has to work.';
  $lang['STORY_8'] = 'Rhobar II ordered to call Grandmaster to his chamber. He didnt have to wait long. Soon in the air appeared a blue aura of teleportation spell and inside materialized character of Xardas. With the sound of broken laws of physics, the mage appeared in the room. He bowed slightly and then his words resonated in the chamber, said with a characteristic sound and tone:';

  $lang['TEAM'] = 'The beginning of SoulFire team reach year 2005 when the redaction of now non-existing service World of Gothic PL decided to translate German and Russian modifications of Gothic games. Mod tools were released on August 2003 but because of 1,5 year delay of "the Night of the Raven" addon in Poland (and lack of access to Polish game scripts) fans were forced to wait. At the turn of 2005 and 2006 there were more and more foreign projects published (modding in Poland was still doing baby steps).. Team decided that this is a good moment to start popularization of mods and provide an extra entertainment to the fans of the game. First polish version published by us (3rd June 2006) was modification of VisiGothic. Between 2006 and 2009 we translated nine modifications to both parts of the game. At the end of 2008 the idea of creating our original project - "The History of Khorinis" - was born. Project in current form is under development since 2015. At present, our team gathers specialists and professionals from all fields - students and professional 2D and 3D graphic artists, designers, concept artists, composer, composers, writers and programmers. All of them share serious approach to their tasks and what is most important - their belief in the project and love of the game. Thanks to great work organization and already mentioned approach we can be proud of the highest level of work quality in the history of modding. Not only among fans of Gothic but also to the game itself. The grandness of our addon is to honor a great plot of the game and climate of its first titles as well as releasing product that stands at the level of the full-fledged part of the series.';
